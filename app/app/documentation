- 12.9-inch iPad screenshots for 2nd and 3rd generation with related portrait and landscape sizes

The first thing you need to do on this matter is to define a story for your screenshots or adequately present them. To do so, you can follow the A.I.D.A (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) copywriting technique. By doing so, you will work on creating engaging screenshots that will make users more likely to download your app.
