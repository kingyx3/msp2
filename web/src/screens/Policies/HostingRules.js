                We require Hosts to follow our rules in these areas, which help create enjoyable events for users:
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Reservation commitment</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                Hosts should honor accepted reservations and provide a reliable registration experience.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Timely communication</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                Hosts should be available to respond to user inquiries or unexpected issues that may come up before and during stays.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Listing accuracy</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                The listing page at the time of booking should accurately describe the space and reflect the features and amenities that will be available at the listing.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Reporting a violation</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                MakeShiftPlans encourages guests to promptly report violations of these ground rules. When a user is dealing with a suspected or actual violation of these hosting rules, we ask that they:
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate with the Host â€” the Host is in the best position to quickly resolve issues.</li>
                    <li>Document the issue using the MakeShiftPlans message thread, photos, etc.</li>
                    <li>If the Host can't resolve the issue, contact us to report the issue directly or request a refund through the Resolution Center.</li>
                    <li>Leave an honest review with feedback so that the Host can improve for future guests.</li>
                </ul>
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Holding Hosts to these rules</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                MakeShiftPlans is committed to enforcing these rules. When a rule violation is reported, MakeShiftPlans will attempt to contact the Host to understand what occurred.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubTitle>Appealing violations</SubTitle>
            <Paragraph>
                Hosts may appeal decisions under this policy by contacting customer support or through the link provided to start the appeals process.
            </Paragraph>
